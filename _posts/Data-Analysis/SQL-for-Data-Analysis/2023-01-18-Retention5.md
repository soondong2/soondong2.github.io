## ID별 첫 번째 임기 시작 날짜와 state
```sql
SELECT
	DISTINCT(id_bioguide),
	MIN(term_start) OVER(PARTITION BY id_bioguide) AS first_term,
	FIRST_VALUE(state) OVER(PARTITION BY id_bioguide ORDER BY term_start) AS first_state
FROM legislators_terms;
```

## state, gender, period별 코호트 숫자
- 위 쿼리를 서브쿼리로 사용한다.
- 이전 게시글에서와 마찬가지로 여러 테이블을 JOIN 한다.
(상세한 JOIN 조건들에 대해서는 이전 글들을 참고)
- A 테이블에서 계산한 first_term이 1917-01-01부터 1999-12-31까지에 해당하는 테이블만을 조회한다.
```sql
SELECT
	A.first_state,
	D.gender,
	COALESCE(DATE_PART('year', AGE(C.date, A.first_term)), 0) AS period,
	COUNT(DISTINCT(A.id_bioguide)) AS cohort_retained
FROM
(
	SELECT
		DISTINCT(id_bioguide),
		MIN(term_start) OVER(PARTITION BY id_bioguide) AS first_term,
		FIRST_VALUE(state) OVER(PARTITION BY id_bioguide ORDER BY term_start) AS first_state
	FROM legislators_terms
) AS A JOIN legislators_terms AS B ON A.id_bioguide = B.id_bioguide
	LEFT JOIN date_dim AS C ON C.date BETWEEN B.term_start AND B.term_end
		AND C.month_name = 'December' AND C.day_of_month = 31
	JOIN legislators AS D ON A.id_bioguide = D.id_bioguide
WHERE A.first_term BETWEEN '1917-01-01' AND '1999-12-31'
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3;
```

## state, gender, period별 코호트 숫자와 비율
- 위 테이블을 서브쿼리로 사용한다.
- state, gender별로 period를 오름차순 정렬했을 때 처음 나타나는 코호트 숫자와 비율을 계산한다.
```sql
SELECT
	first_state,
	gender,
	period,
	cohort_retained,
	FIRST_VALUE(cohort_retained) OVER(PARTITION BY first_state, gender ORDER BY period) AS cohort_size,
	ROUND(cohort_retained * 1.0 / FIRST_VALUE(cohort_retained) OVER(PARTITION BY first_state, gender ORDER BY period), 2) AS pct_retained
FROM
(
	SELECT
		A.first_state,
		D.gender,
		COALESCE(DATE_PART('year', AGE(C.date, A.first_term)), 0) AS period,
		COUNT(DISTINCT(A.id_bioguide)) AS cohort_retained
	FROM
	(
		SELECT
			DISTINCT(id_bioguide),
			MIN(term_start) OVER(PARTITION BY id_bioguide) AS first_term,
			FIRST_VALUE(state) OVER(PARTITION BY id_bioguide ORDER BY term_start) AS first_state
		FROM legislators_terms
	) AS A JOIN legislators_terms AS B ON A.id_bioguide = B.id_bioguide
		LEFT JOIN date_dim AS C ON C.date BETWEEN B.term_start AND B.term_end
			AND C.month_name = 'December' AND C.day_of_month = 31
		JOIN legislators AS D ON A.id_bioguide = D.id_bioguide
	WHERE A.first_term BETWEEN '1917-01-01' AND '1999-12-31'
	GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
) AS sub;
```

## gender, state별 코호트 숫자
```sql
SELECT
	B.gender,
	A.first_state,
	COUNT(DISTINCT(A.id_bioguide)) AS cohort_size
FROM
(
	SELECT
		DISTINCT(id_bioguide),
		MIN(term_start) OVER(PARTITION BY id_bioguide) AS first_term,
		FIRST_VALUE(state) OVER(PARTITION BY id_bioguide ORDER BY term_start) AS first_state
	FROM legislators_terms
) AS A JOIN legislators AS B ON A.id_bioguide = B.id_bioguide
WHERE A.first_term BETWEEN '1917-01-01' AND '1999-12-31'
GROUP BY 1, 2;
```

## 이전 테이블과 period JOIN
- 해당 테이블을 T1이라고 가정하자.
```sql
SELECT B.gender, B.first_state, C.period, B.cohort_size
FROM
(
	SELECT B.gender, A.first_state, COUNT(DISTINCT(A.id_bioguide)) AS cohort_size
	FROM
	(
		SELECT
			DISTINCT(id_bioguide),
			MIN(term_start) OVER(PARTITION BY id_bioguide) AS first_term,
			FIRST_VALUE(state) OVER(PARTITION BY id_bioguide ORDER BY term_start ASC) AS first_state
		FROM legislators_terms
	) AS A JOIN legislators AS B ON A.id_bioguide = B.id_bioguide
	WHERE A.first_term BETWEEN '1917-01-01' AND '1999-12-31'
	GROUP BY 1, 2
) AS B JOIN (SELECT generate_series AS period
			FROM generate_series(0, 20, 1)) AS C ON 1 = 1;
```

## state, gender, period별 코호트 숫자
- 해당 테이블은 이전 게시글에서 다뤘던 내용과 같은 쿼리이다.
- 해당 테이블을 T2라고 가정하자.
```sql
SELECT
	D.first_state,
	G.gender,
	COALESCE(DATE_PART('year', AGE(F.date, D.first_term)), 0) AS period,
	COUNT(DISTINCT(D.id_bioguide)) AS cohort_retained
FROM
(
	SELECT
		DISTINCT(id_bioguide),
		MIN(term_start) OVER(PARTITION BY id_bioguide) AS first_term,
		FIRST_VALUE(state) OVER(PARTITION BY id_bioguide ORDER BY term_start ASC) AS first_state
	FROM legislators_terms
) AS D JOIN legislators_terms AS E ON D.id_bioguide = E.id_bioguide
	LEFT JOIN date_dim AS F ON F.date BETWEEN E.term_start AND E.term_end
		AND F.month_name = 'December' AND F.day_of_month = 31
	JOIN legislators AS G ON D.id_bioguide = G.id_bioguide
WHERE D.first_term BETWEEN '1917-01-01' AND '1999-12-31'
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3;
```
